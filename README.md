#What the course is all about?
We will be dealing with images and learning how to manipulate them initially and alongwith all the 
maths that will go in learning them. Also we will be seeing when to use them after 7 weeks with different use cases.

## What will be the course outcomes?
1. You will be creating your own personal image processing library.
2. Learning about artificial deep neural nets and maybe if time permits Convolutional Neural Nets.
3. Learn different techniques like image resizing, thresholding, paranoma stitching etc.

## What are the prerequisites?
1. Able to write and read C and python code .
2. Basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus.
3. Basic data structures like knowledge of array and static and dynamic memory allocation will be very helpful.
4. Give time : Remember that the most of the scientists solve a problem not when awake but by sleeping on the problem. I will be giving you with all the details where to learn but you should be the one asking for it.
