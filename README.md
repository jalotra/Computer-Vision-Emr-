# What the course is all about?
We will be dealing with images and learning how to manipulate them in a bottom up manner that is alongwith all the maths. Also we will be seeing when to use them with some projects after 7 weeks with different use cases.

## What will be the course outcomes?
1. You will be creating your own personal image processing library.
2. Learning about artificial deep neural nets and maybe if time permits Convolutional Neural Nets.
3. Learn different techniques like image resizing, thresholding, paranoma stitching etc.

## What are the prerequisites?
1. Able to write and read C and python code .
2. Basic linear algebra and multivariable calculus.
3. Basic data structures like knowledge of array and static and dynamic memory allocation will be very helpful.
4. Give time : Remember that the most of the scientists solve a problem not when awake but by sleeping on the problem. I will be giving you with all the details where to learn but you should be the one asking for it.


## LETS START
**We will be using a great course that goes with the name Ancient Secrets of Computer Vision**
The course is originally given by Joseph Redmon who goes with the username Pjreddie. He is the guy who developed Darknet and YOLO (You look only once). I very much urge you to carefully watch his Ted Talk and appreciate the greatness of his work. [JOSEPH_REDMON_IN_ACTION](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgxsv1riJhI) 


# WEEK 1 DETAILS

### Video Lectures to go through
1. Lecture 1 : *INTRODUCTION*
2. Lecture 2 : *HUMAN VISION, COLOR SPACES, TRANSFORMS*

### Work to do
1. Copy or clone (-- Whatever you like!!) this github repository : [Link](https://github.com/jalotra/Week1HW)
2. You will be writing all the modules for different Weeks in this repository.
2. And by the end of this course what you will have is your custom made IMAGE PROCESSING LIBRARY.
